# Hw 1

- Create a variable called "name" and assign it a string value of your name.

- Create a variable called "age" and assign it a number value of your age.

- Create a variable called "isStudent" and assign it a Boolean value of whether or not you are currently a student.

- Create a variable called "classSchedule" and assign it an array of strings representing the classes you are currently taking.

- Use console.log() to print out your name, age, and whether or not you are a student.

- Use a for loop to iterate through your class schedule array and print out each class.

- Create a function called "addClass" that takes in a string parameter called "newClass" and adds it to the class schedule array.

# HW 2
- Store your date of birth in a variable using the new Date() function.

- Store it in the month function using getMonth() function.

- Store it in the day function using getDate() function
 
- After you are done create a new variable containing the current date

- Store the current month

- Store the current day

- Finally, compare the month and day. If the day and month are the same as the date and month of your birth, print a message congratulating. If it is not the same date, print a message stating that today is not your birthday.

# Ch

- Create an array called "books" that contains at least 5 objects, each representing a book. Each book object should have properties for the title, author, number of pages, and whether or not it is available for borrowing.

- Use a for loop to iterate through the books array and print out the title, author, and number of pages for each book.

- Create a function called "borrowBook" that takes in two parameters, the title of the book and the name of the borrower. The function should check if the book is available for borrowing, and if so, it should update the book's availability to false and add a new property to the book object called "borrower" with the value of the borrower's name. If the book is not available, the function should print out a message saying so.

- Create a function called "returnBook" that takes in the title of the book as a parameter. The function should check if the book has a "borrower" property and if so, it should update the book's availability to true and remove the "borrower" property. If the book does not have a "borrower" property, the function should print out a message saying that the book was never borrowed.

- Test your functions by borrowing and returning a few books from the books array.

- Use a for loop to iterate through the books array and print out the title, author, number of pages, and borrower (if any) for each book.

- Create a function called "addBook" that takes in an object representing a new book and adds it to the books array.

- Create a function called "searchBook" that takes in a search term as a parameter and returns an array of all books in the books array that contain the search term in the title, author or borrower name.

- Test your searchBook function by calling it with different search terms and print out the results.
